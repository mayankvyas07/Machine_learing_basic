    "\n",
    "A) Train, test, and validation split is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate and tune models effectively. The dataset is divided into three subsets:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Set: This portion of the dataset is used to train the machine learning model. It contains both input data and their corresponding output labels (in supervised learning). The model learns from this data and tries to generalize patterns to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "Test Set: After the model is trained, it is tested on the test set, which contains data separate from the training set. The test set helps assess how well the model performs on unseen data. It provides an estimate of the model's real-world performance.\n",
    "Validation Set: In some cases, a validation set is used to fine-tune the model during training. It helps in hyperparameter tuning and model selection. The validation set allows optimizing the model without overfitting it to the test set.\n",
    "The importance of each split:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training set: It is crucial for training the model and learning the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "Test set: It provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data, helping to assess generalization capability.\n",

    "\n",
    "A) Unsupervised learning is particularly useful for anomaly detection because it can identify patterns in the data without the need for labeled anomalies. Anomalies are data points that significantly deviate from the normal behavior or patterns in the dataset. Here's how unsupervised learning can be used for anomaly detection:\n",
